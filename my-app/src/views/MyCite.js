                            At Mobiquity, I worked on the MYCITE system to build a native iOS and Android
                            app and web-based portal. As a FDA-regulated product, the MYCITE product depends
                            on human factor studies and development of new features that focus on a userâ€™s
                            comprehension of tasks in order to optimize the efficiency, safety, and ease
                            of learning for its targeted users.
                        </p>

                    <div className="column">
                        <p>
                            As the lead designer on the project, I guided the development of app designs
                            and documentation for the product's FDA submission as well as built mockups and
                            prototypes for user testing. Working under a heavily-regulated medical product,
                            design concepts were focused on providing clear and easy to understand information
                            through straightforward directions and guidance.
