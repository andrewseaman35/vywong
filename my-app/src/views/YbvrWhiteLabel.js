                            Through my interviews, I found that there were two types of travelers:
                            Travis, the travel-when-I-can, and Emily, the travel-to-see-it-all.
                            With the assumption that users who extensively planned trips would be
                            desktop users, I wanted to focus my initial prototype on Travis, the
                            on-the-go weekend tripper in order to targer mobile users with high
                            app usage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the core experience, I tailored to the impromptu traveling habits
                            of Travis and designed a flow that would allow for an expedited process
                            to finding a route with sites nearby. Throughout the wireframing and
                            mockup process, I gathered user feedback to refine the exploration
                            experience from account creation to route navigation.

                        <p>
                            With the information gathered from usability tests, I would want to
                            build a second iteration of offered users the ability to save created
                            routes or plan a trip in advance. Contary to my initial assumption
                            that people on the go do not have any time to plan, if given a method
                            to expedite the route creation process, users would find time to plan
                            a little in advance.

                        <p>
                            In addition, although Traverse does offer a single experience to create
                            and navigate to discover new places, users feel comfortable referencing
                            apps they use often. Because of this, I would explore app integrations
                            to offer users both a fluid experience and familiarity of what they
                            currently use.

                            While analyzing the apps I frequented, I began to notice that the apps
                            did bits and pieces of the exploration process, but none captured the
                            full process of discovering, mapping, and navigating a user through an
                            entire exploration. The opportunity I saw was the ability to combine
                            all of those sections into one fluid experience.

                            as well as target users for the app. I conducted interviews with
                            people who said they liked to explore to get clearer understanding of
                            how people explored local spots and when traveling. I focused my
                            questions around how they found and planned their trips as well as
                            what they liked and felt frustration about their planning and the
                            execution of their exploration. Based on the information gathered, I
                            built personas that encompassed two types of explorers: Emily and Travis.

                            take impromptu weekend trips, they would have more opportunities to
                            utilize the core feature of the app: expedited route discovery and
                            navigation.

                            With the layout from the wireframes, I began to build Traverse's brand.
                            I built a style guide that encompassed Traverse's modern aesthetic with a
                            dark theme, accented with bright colors, and a clean, refined typeface.

                            Based on the style guide, I created high fidelity mockups for the screens
                            and built an InVision prototype to capture the user journeys through the
                            app and walk the user through key flows.
